----------------------------------------------------------
### go help 
- fmt for formatted I/O.
- go mod init golang
- go run .
- go env GOPATH : to see the path of the go workspace in my machine
- lexer checks code following the rules of the language
- go case sensitive 
- everything in go is a type [ String , Bool , Integer , Floot , Complex]
- variable declaration
  - var var_name type = value
  - example var name string = "Golang"
  - default value of string is empty string , default value of int is 0 , default value of bool is false etc
- no var style [ most common style]
  - var_name := value
  - example name := "Golang"
  - Its only possible inside function , we cant use it outside function(globally)

- no new variables on left side of `:=`
- keyword with small first letter is private , keyword with capital first letter is public
- memory allocation , deallocation is done by go automatically [ garbage collection]
- nil = NULL
- slices are like array but they are dynamic in nature[ they can grow and shrink  using append]
- always close request body whenever we call  
- everything come from web is in byte format , so we need to convert it to string
